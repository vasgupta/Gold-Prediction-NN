# Gold-Prediction-NN
A repo that uses neural network to predict Gold prices.

Instructions on how to be used:
1. Use Mergefile.py to create a csv with all the input variables neatly organized. The csv is called 'Input.csv'.
2. Use 'Daily Gold Price.R' to run the Neural network on the Input file created. Once run, it will return the Gold value predictions from April 2nd, 2018 to June 29th, 2018. 
3. RUN 'LSTM.py' to create a LSTM RNN neural network, which will predict the gold prices.
